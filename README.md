## Technology Standards and Best Practices

### Welcome to Red Pepper Software's Best Practices Repo

Please do not hesitate to make suggestions, add content or ask questions. Standards change over time and this is the place where they can all be written down to help bring consistency and ease of use to the project you are working on. There are many different subjects that have been standardized and links have been provided here to help facilitate the discovery of those. 

Please reference our [Contributing Guide Lines](./SupportingFiles/Contributing.md)

Many standards will have a lot of information related to them as well as many platforms that they refer to. IE Mobile, Backend, Front End, Project Management etc. In order to facilitate this we have different sections of this repo devoted to them. If there is something missing or you have an idea to improve things let us know.
